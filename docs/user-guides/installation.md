## Step 1: Install Golang <a id="step1"></a>
:::info Note

Babylon requires Golang [version 1.20](https://go.dev/doc/install) for Babylon to be installed on your system.
Install it using the instructions on the provided link.

:::

After you install it, you can verify that you have the proper version by running:
```console
$ go version
go version go1.20 darwin/amd64
```

## Step 2: Build and Install Babylon <a id="step2"></a>
You need to clone Babylonâ€™s GitHub repository to install the `babylond` executable.

1. Install build requirements
```console
sudo apt install git build-essential curl jq --yes
```
2. Retrieve the Babylon source code either through the [releases page](https://github.com/babylonchain/babylon/releases) or by cloning the [source code](https://github.com/babylonchain/babylon). In case you want to create a full node for the testnet, it is highly recommended that you choose the release corresponding to the current testnet. See the [testnet network information](/docs/testnet/network-information.md) page for more details.
3. Navigate to the directory that contains the Babylon source code. From there build and install the babylond executable
```console
git checkout <version_to_install>
make install
```

:::info Note

The last command first executes `git checkout` in the specific version that you want to install.
Ensure that you install the same version of the Babylon executable as the one that is running on the network you aim to join.
