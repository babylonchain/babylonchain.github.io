# Overview of Validator Deployment

![Overview of validator deployment](images/overview.png)

In this testnet, Babylon bitcoin staking protocol secures the Babylon PoS chain
via an extra round of voting on top of the CometBFT consensus, called the
*finality round*. This round is conducted by *finality providers*, which are the
validators that accepts bitcoin stake delegations. Finality providers use their
EOTS keys to cast finality votes on the Babylon blocks generated by ComeBFT. A
Babylon block that receives more than 2/3 finality votes from the active
finality provider set is BTC-finalized.

Therefore, one can join BTC staking testnet via one (or more) of the three sets of actions:

1. become a *Babylon CometBFT validator* and accept Babylon test token
delegations. For this, you need to deploy and maintain a Babylon node daemon.
2. become a *finality provider* and accept BTC signet toke delegations. For this,
   you need to deploy and maintain
   - an EOTS manager daemon, which manages your EOTS keys; and
   - a finality provider, which connects to a Babylon node you trust to cast
    finality votes.
3. To *self-delegate* BTC signet tokens in a trustless way, you can run a BTC
signet node and a BTC staker program. But you donâ€™t need to keep them up.
Alternatively, you could self-delegate BTC Signet tokens via the staking web
application provided by the Babylon team.
