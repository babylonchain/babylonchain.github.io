# Staking API

The Staking API Service is a critical component of the Babylon Phase-1 system,
focused on serving information about the state of the network
and receiving unbonding requests for further processing.
The API can be utilised by user facing applications, such as staking dApps.

## 1. Hardware Requirements

- CPU: Multi-core processor (4 cores minimum)
- Memory: Minimum 4GB RAM, recommended 8GB RAM

## 2. Install Staking API

### 2.1 Clone the repository to your local machine from Github

```bash
git clone git@github.com:babylonchain/staking-api-service.git
```

### 2.2 Check out the desired version

You can find the latest release
[here](https://github.com/babylonchain/staking-api-service/releases).

```bash
cd staking-api-service
git checkout tags/{VERSION}
```

### 2.3 Install the binary by running

```bash
make install
```

## 3. Configuration

### 3.1 Create home directory

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.staking-api-service/
```

### 3.2 Copy the default configuration

```bash
cp ~/staking-api-service/config/config-local.yml ~/.staking-api-service/config.yml
```

### 3.3 Update default configurations

- MongoDB cluster to connect to

Set the MongoDB connection address (`address`)
and credentials (`username`, `password`, and `db-name`) to match
the information from the
[installed MongoDB cluster](../infra/mongodb.md).

```yml
db:
  address: "mongodb://localhost:27017/?directConnection=true"
  username: "<username>"
  password: "<password>"
  db-name: "<db-name>"
```

- RabbitMQ cluster to connect to

Set the RabbitMQ connection address (`url`)
and credentials (`queue_user` and `queue_password`)
to match the information from the
[installed RabbitMQ cluster](../infra/rabbitmq.md).

```yml
queue:
  queue_user: admin
  queue_password: password
  url: "localhost:5672"
```

- Prometheus metrics configuration:

Set the `host` and `port` to customize how the metrics are exposed

```yml
metrics:
  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 2112
```

## 4. Download global params

To run the Staking API, a `global-params.json` file
which defines all the staking parameters is needed.

To download the global parameters,
follow [these](../global-system-configuration.md#staking-parameters) instructions.

## 5. Download finality providers

To run the Staking API, a `finality-provider.json` file
that associates finality provider
BTC public keys with additional information about them such
as their moniker, commission is needed.

To generate the concatenated finality providers information
from Babylon registry,
follow [these](../global-system-configuration.md#22-generating-concatenated-finality-provider-information)
instructions.

## 6. Start Staking API

You can start the Staking API by running:

```bash
staking-api-service --config ~/.staking-api-service/config.yml \
--params ~/.staking-api-service/global-params.json \
--finality-providers ~/.staking-api-service/finality-providers.json
```

## 7. Create systemd service (Optional - Linux Only)

### 7.1 Create systemd service definition

Run the following command, replacing `system_username`
with the appropriate system user or service account name:

```bash
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/staking-api.service
[Unit]
Description=Staking API service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=$(which staking-api-service)  \
          --config /home/system_username/.staking-api-service/config.yml \
          --params /home/system_username/.staking-api-service/global-params.json \
          --finality-providers /home/system_username/.staking-api-service/finality-providers.json
Restart=on-failure
User=system_username

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

### 7.2 Reload systemd manager configuration

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

### 7.3 Enable the service to start on boot

```bash
sudo systemctl enable staking-api.service
```

### 7.4 Start the service

```bash
sudo systemctl start staking-api.service
```

### 7.5. Verify Staking API is running

Check staking-api service status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status staking-api
```

Expected log:

```accesslog

```

## 8. Monitoring

The service exposes Prometheus metrics through a Prometheus server.
By default, the server is reachable under `127.0.0.1:2112`.
