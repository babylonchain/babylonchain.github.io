# Global System Configuration

## Staking Parameters

The Global Configuration includes a series of versioned governance parameters that greatly affect the behaviour of the system. Detailed information can be found [here](https://github.com/babylonchain/networks/tree/main/bbn-test-4/parameters).

## Finality Providers
Bitcoin holders that stake their Bitcoin can use Babylon's staking web application to select the finality provider they want to delegate their attestation of power to. They do so by including the finality provider's BTC public key in the self-custodial Bitcoin Staking script.
