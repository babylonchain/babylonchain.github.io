# Backend deployment

The Babylon Bitcoin staking will be launched in phases. The first phase
will only involve Bitcoin holders submitting Bitcoin staking transactions to
the Bitcoin chain to lock their Bitcoins, **without** any Proof of Stake (PoS)
chain operating to be secured by the stake.

The aim of this document is to demonstrate how to deploy
the Babylon lock-only Bitcoin Staking Backend System.

This guide is structured as follows:

1. [Deployment Overview](./deployment-overview.md):
a high-level overview of the deployment processes,
including the main components and their roles within the system.
2. [Required Infrastructure Services Setup](./infra/overview.md):
This section covers the installation and configuration of essential services
3. [BTC Staking Backend Services Setup](./services/overview.md):
After setting up the required infrastructure,
proceed with the installation and configuration of the BTC staking backend services.
4. [Global System Configuration](./global-system-configuration.md):
Includes system-wide Staking parameters.
