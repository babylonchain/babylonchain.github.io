# Babylon Overview

<!-- Babylon vision -->
Babylon project designs security protocols that scale Bitcoin to secure the decentralized world.
To this end, Babylon utilizes the three primary facets of Bitcoin: bitcoin the asset, Bitcoin the PoW-secured timestamping server, and Bitcoin the most censorship-resistant blockspace in the world.
Through inventing pioneering protocols, Babylon envisions a more secure and Bitcoin-centric decentralized world.

<!-- Two protocols in Babylon. BTC timestamping is a building block for Bitcoin staking -->
To realize the vision, we build [Babylon](https://github.com/babylonchain/babylon), a suite of Bitcoin security-sharing protocols.
Currently, it includes two protocols:

- **Bitcoin timestamping:** This protocol sends succinct and verifiable timestamps of any data (such as PoS blockchains) to Bitcoin; and
- **Bitcoin staking:** This protocol allows bitcoin the asset to provide economic security to any decentralized systems through trustless (and self-custodian) staking.

The Babylon team is developing the core primitives of the Bitcoin staking protocol and will open source it very soon.
This documentation provides a brief overview of the design.
More documents will be published after open source.

The following figure provides the high-level architecture of the Babylon system.
The two protocols enable enormous security-related use cases for the decentralized world.
One primary use case is to bring BTC security to PoS chains.
