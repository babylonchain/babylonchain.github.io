# Babylon Overview

<!-- Babylon vision -->
Babylon project designs security protocols that scale Bitcoin to secure the decentralized world.
To this end, Babylon utilizes the three primary facets of Bitcoin: Bitcoin the asset, Bitcoin the reliable timestamping server, and Bitcoin the blockchain that contains the most censorship-resistant blockspace in the world.
Through inventing pioneering protocols, Babylon envisions a more secure and decentralized future.

<!-- Two protocols in Babylon. BTC timestamping is a building block for BTC staking -->
We build the [Babylon](https://github.com/babylonchain/babylon) blockchain to realize the vision.
It is a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain that consists of two innovative security-sharing protocols between Bitcoin and other PoS blockchains:

- **Bitcoin timestamping:** This protocol sends succinct and verifiable timestamps of PoS blockchains to Bitcoin; and
- **Bitcoin staking:** Using Bitcoin timestamping as a building block, this protocol allows Bitcoin holders to stake their Bitcoin to PoS blockchains.

The following figure provides the high-level architecture of the Babylon system.
The two protocols enable enormous security-related use cases for the decentralized world.
One primary use case is to bring BTC security to PoS chains.
