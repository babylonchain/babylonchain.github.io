# 1. Babylon Overview <a id="overview"></a>
Babylon is a PoS (proof-of-stake) blockchain that provides secure Bitcoin timestamps to its transactions. Babylon is built using the Tendermint consensus engine and Cosmos SDK. It leverages cutting-edge cryptographic technologies and advanced Cosmos SDK features to send succinct, verifiable, and adversary-slashing checkpoints of the Babylon chain to BTC as BTC transactions. The BTC timestamps of Babylon checkpoints provide BTC-level security to all Babylon transactions.

Below is a high-level architecture of the Babylon system. Babylon can be viewed as a checkpoint verifier and aggregator. It verifies and aggregates the checkpoints submitted by its users into ones that BTC can securely timestamp.

This primitive enables enormous security-related use cases for the decentralized world. One motivating and primary use case is to bring BTC security to PoS chains.
