:::info
Please use the wrapped messages in the [epoching](/docs/cli/babylond/Babylond_tx/Babylond_tx_epoching) and 
[checkpointing](/docs/cli/babylond/Babylond_tx/Babylond_tx_checkpointing) module to perform
staking-related operations.

In order to keep the validator set unchanged in the middle of epochs, the epoching
module intercepts and rejects staking-related messages that affect validator sets via
AnteHandler, but instead defines wrapped versions of them and forwards their
unwrapped forms to the staking module upon an epoch ends. Read more [here](/docs/developer-guides/modules/epoching.md#delaying-wrapped-messages-to-the-end-of-epochs)
